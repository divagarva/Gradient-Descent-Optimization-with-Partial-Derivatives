# Gradient-Descent-Optimization-with-Partial-Derivatives
 This Python project demonstrates gradient descent optimization using partial derivatives. It finds the minimum of a multivariable function by iteratively moving towards the lowest point based on the gradient. The process is visualized with a plot showing the descent path and how the algorithm converges.
